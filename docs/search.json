    "text": "1.1 Significance of CABG\nCABG (pronounced “cabbage”) is a kind of surgery to reroute blood around a blockage caused by heart disease in the heart through a new artery. Also known as single/double/triple bypass surgery, this procedure is used to alleviate symptoms of heart disease and may prolong life expectancy. It can be elective or emergency based if the patient has suffered a heart attack. 1 While it is not the only procedure or treatment for heart disease, it is the most common type of heart surgery in the United States with over 300,000 patients undergoing the procedure a year. 2 The actual surgery uses a graft, a surgically removed piece of a vein from somewhere else in the body (usually the heart), to bypass the blockage by connecting to the proper arteries and veins that the blocked artery would have used."

    "text": "1.2 CABG Complications\nAs of 2021, heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the United States over cancer and COVID-19. 3 It is essential, therefore, to understand and classify the treatment procedures for the constant improvement and effectivity of surgeries that treat such a lethal disease. As with any procedure, there are risks and complications that can impact the potentially life-saving or life-improving effects of the surgery. Further, for certain patients, the surgery may be elective. Thus, it is even more critical to understand the complications associated with CABG.\nUp to 14% of patients report to the emergency room with post-operative complications. 4 These readmission frequencies to the hospital are helpful metrics to make conclusions about the overall riskiness of a certain surgery as well as the quality of the care the patient originally received during the surgery. As such, an important part of any study of the riskiness of a surgery not only should include complications, but also the readmission statistics for the surgery. With access to recent data, it is necessary to evaluate current trends in readmissions from complications from CABG procedures."

    "text": "1.3 Research Questions\nTo briefly discuss our data, we will explore a dataset that reports a subset of complications and readmission counts associated with CABG surgeries in the state of California over the years of 2018-2021. This dataset is one of the only de-identified datasets with age, race, and gender data included with a fairly exhaustive categorization of the various complications as well as information about how many of each demographic did or did not face these complications and subsequent readmission. With the context of the surgery’s significance and this data, we hope to answer the following questions:\n\nDoes our data change over time in terms of frequency of complications, readmissions, and demographics/medical information?\nWhat are the most common complications associated with CABG?\nWhat complications most often lead to readmission to the hospital?\nDoes your demographic data and medical information impact your likelihood to face a complication from a CABG procedure?\nDoes your demographic data and medical information impact your likelihood that you will be readmitted to the hospital regardless of complication?\nDoes your demographic data, medical information, and complication impact your likelihood that you will be readmitted to the hospital?"

    "text": "2.1 Description\nWe found multiple datasets on the California Health and Human Services Agency’s (CalHHS) Open Data Portal. In particular, to explore cardiovascular health of different demographics, we found a dataset called “Readmissions for Isolated Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Complications”. 1\nThe dataset includes the latest publicly available data from the California Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Outcomes Reporting Program (CCORP), used for its annual performance reporting requirements. Every six months, hospitals around the state of California submit clinical data through a secure online web application to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). A “Data Contact” person at each hospital acts as a liaison between CCORP and cardiac surgeons. Once the data is finalized and officially submitted to the state, CCORP requires surgeons to review their data and sign a “Surgeon Certification Form.” This certification affirms that surgeons have reviewed their data, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the cases assigned to them. 2\nThe initial dataset was created two years ago, but was updated as recently as 2 weeks ago. It is unclear how long it will take for more recent years to get added to the dataset.\nThe data is published as a CSV file, which makes importing it a simple task. We can just use R’s built-in read.csv function to import the data after downloading the dataset onto our local computer. We can see that there are 1008 observations (rows) and 7 variables (columns) in the data frame after importing the dataset.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(redav)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncab = read.csv(\"cab.csv\") |&gt; rename(\"Complication\" = complication,\"Category\" = category,\"Readmission\" = readmission, \"Percentage Readmitted\"=Yes)\nstr(cab)\n\n\n'data.frame':   1008 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ Year                 : chr  \"2018-2019\" \"2018-2019\" \"2018-2019\" \"2018-2019\" ...\n $ Complication         : chr  \"Deep Sternal Infection\" \"Deep Sternal Infection\" \"Deep Sternal Infection\" \"Deep Sternal Infection\" ...\n $ Category             : chr  \"Age\" \"Age\" \"Age\" \"All\" ...\n $ Strata               : chr  \"0 to 40\" \"41-65\" \"66 to Max\" \"All\" ...\n $ Readmission          : chr  \"N\" \"N\" \"N\" \"N\" ...\n $ Percentage Readmitted: num  0 0.00109 0.00081 0.00093 0.00169 0.00082 0.00075 0.00122 0.00085 0.00162 ...\n $ Count                : int  0 11 11 22 5 16 1 6 16 1 ...\n\n\nEach row contains the count of a complication, given a certain category and strata within that category, with subsequent readmission counts. This can be seen clearly by printing out the first couple of rows:\n\nCode\nkable(cab[1:6, ], caption = \"Head of our data\")\n\n\n\nHead of our data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nComplication\nCategory\nStrata\nReadmission\nPercentage Readmitted\nCount\n\n\n\n\n2018-2019\nDeep Sternal Infection\nAge\n0 to 40\nN\n0.00000\n0\n\n\n2018-2019\nDeep Sternal Infection\nAge\n41-65\nN\n0.00109\n11\n\n\n2018-2019\nDeep Sternal Infection\nAge\n66 to Max\nN\n0.00081\n11\n\n\n2018-2019\nDeep Sternal Infection\nAll\nAll\nN\n0.00093\n22\n\n\n2018-2019\nDeep Sternal Infection\nCABG type\nCABG+Valve\nN\n0.00169\n5\n\n\n2018-2019\nDeep Sternal Infection\nCABG type\nIsolated CABG\nN\n0.00082\n16\n\n\n\n\nOne issue we can see right away is that some strata do not have any counts for complications.\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nfiltered = cab |&gt; filter(Count == 0)\nkable(filtered[1:6, ], caption = \"Head of our filtered data with 0 counts\")\n\n\n\nHead of our filtered data with 0 counts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nComplication\nCategory\nStrata\nReadmission\nPercentage Readmitted\nCount\n\n\n\n\n2018-2019\nDeep Sternal Infection\nAge\n0 to 40\nN\n0\n0\n\n\n2018-2019\nDeep Sternal Infection\nPayorType\nUninsured\nN\n0\n0\n\n\n2018-2019\nDeep Sternal Infection\nRace\nNative\nN\n0\n0\n\n\n2018-2019\nPost-Operative Dialysis\nPayorType\nUninsured\nN\n0\n0\n\n\n2018-2019\nPost-Operative Dialysis\nRace\nNative\nN\n0\n0\n\n\n2018-2019\nPost-Operative Renal Failure\nPayorType\nUninsured\nN\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\nFrom this selection, we can see that there are certain groups that are either underrepresented or are generally less at risk for heart disease and therefore less in need of the CABG surgical procedure. It makes sense that the youngest age group - “0 to 40” - is less at risk than older age groups but we would still expect perhaps a few rare cases of heart disease. Similarly, we would also expect there to be some cases of heart disease for the Native American group, but it is likely an underrepresented population in this data. 3 Additionally, we can see that patients that are uninsured seem to have fewer instances of heart disease. This seems paradoxical, as uninsured patients are generally more at risk for health issues and worse health outcomes than insured patients. 4 However, it is also known that “uninsured individuals are less likely than those with insurance to receive preventive care and services for major health conditions and chronic diseases”. 5"

In order to analyze this, we will compare the counts for each categorical variable over each year. Given that we only have three years of data, we expect to see relatively little change over time.\nTo determine the most common complications associated with CABG, we can use the data to identify and visualize the most frequent complications by focusing on the Complication variable. This visualization can be done with a simple bar chart.\nTo address which complications most often lead to readmission to the hospital, we will examine the relationship between complications and readmission. We can create a visual such as a bar chart or an alluvial plot to display this.\nIn order to understand how demographic data impacts the likelihood to face a complication from a CABG procedure, we will use the \\(\\chi^2\\) test. We can also visualize this with a mosaic plot.\nFinally, to investigate how demographic data impacts the likelihood of readmission given any particular complication, we can similarly use a \\(\\chi^2\\) test and mosaic plot."

This is likely due to de-identification protocols which is a standard practice for HIPAA compliance. HIPAA compliance is important so that publicly available patient data is not traceable back to a specific person. Our data for instance does not have entries that relate specific complications to both Age and Race at the same time. Instead we only have demographic data for each complication, but no overlap in types of demographics which are called Strata in our data. The plot above shows how each entry in our data lacks those relationships. We can see that each row always has an entry for Complication, Count, Percentage Readmitted, Readmission, and Year.\nUsing the ‘redav’ package, we can see the same patterns that we observed above:\n\n\nCode\ncabg = cab |&gt; subset(Category !=\"All\")\nwide_cabg = new_wide |&gt; rename(\"Comp\" = Complication, \"Perc.Readmit\" = `Percentage Readmitted`, \"Readmitted\"= Readmission) |&gt; subset(select = -c(All))\nplot_missing(cabg, percent = TRUE)\n\n\nScale for y is already present.\nAdding another scale for y, which will replace the existing scale.\nScale for y is already present.\nAdding another scale for y, which will replace the existing scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_missing(wide_cabg, percent = TRUE)\n\n\nScale for y is already present.\nAdding another scale for y, which will replace the existing scale.\nScale for y is already present.\nAdding another scale for y, which will replace the existing scale."

The other three complications were not skewed towards readmission, yet they still followed the trend of having more readmission cases than not."

    "section": "5.1 Main Takeaways",
    "text": "5.1 Main Takeaways\nFrom our analysis, we can draw several conclusions about the relationships between demographic and medical data, CABG complication data, and post-CABG hospital readmission data.\nFirst, Other Insurance type was one of the greatest predictors of readmission. We saw nearly no one with Other Insurance be readmitted to the hospital no matter what their complication was. Even though we do not know what exact insurance this strata contains, we can speculate that it is group plans offered through work. In this case, it may be better overall insurance, increasing the quality of care they receive initially for their complications and thereby preventing readmission.\nSecond, Black and Hispanic for the Race category and Female for the Gender category were almost always more likely to be readmitted to the hospital, especially for Post-Operative Atrial Fibrillation, Post-Operative Dialysis, and Post-Operative Renal Failure. This indicates a possible gap in quality care for these underrepresented communities, further backed up by the lack of actual patients for all these groups.\nWe also saw some other tangential conclusions. We consistently saw an inverse relationship between Post-Operative Atrial Fibrillation and Prolonged Ventilation for nearly every strata and complication comparison. This may suggest that risk factors for each complication are opposite from each other. Also, Age is not as strong of a predictor as we previously thought would be due to the increased risk factors of heart disease with increased age."

    "text": "5.2 Limitations\nOne major limitation of this analysis is the fact that the data was de-identified healthcare data. Chiefly, this data lacked the eventual health outcomes of the patients. While this is understandable safeguard for patient privacy, it made our eventual conclusions about the data weaker because we do not know if the readmissions or lack thereof were necessarily adverse outcomes without the information. Instead, our conclusions are related to readmission to the hospital which could lead to positive or negative outcome for overall health. Further, in analyzing demographic data, the lack of data showing the relationship between demographics prevents exploration into the intersectional nature of these factors and their relationship to surgical complications and hospital readmission rates. The ambiguity of the data overall including the lack of clarity on other categories in the Insurance Type and Surgical Procedure categories also prevented a more nuanced understanding of the potential influencing factors on hospital readmission rates and surgical complications. Additionally, analysis on certain demographics such as uninsured patients or Native American patients was limited due to the lack of representation of such groups in the data."

Moreover, the relationship between Insurance Type and Readmission is puzzling at best, especially with the ambiguity of the data previously discussed. A study into this strong dependence would be illuminating to the cause of this relationship."

    "text": "5.4 Lessons Learned\nMosaics plots are much harder to compare across different sample sizes. When faceting on Complication to create mosaic plots for Readmission and each category’s strata, having the plots being the same size next to each other was a bit misleading about the differences in the length and width worked in relation to each other. The \\(\\chi^2\\) tests helped handle this issue as it showed empirically what relationships were significant and which were not. In the future, making some more custom visualizations such as a proportional mosaic combined into one plot to show all relationships at once with overall frequency should be considered."
